          We are not called to just "do" ministry. Rather, fruitful ministry is
          the overflow of a heart connected to the Father. This program seeks to
          help you grow in your love for Jesus as well as teach you the tools to
          lead others. Like Paul said, "Follow me as I follow Jesus."
